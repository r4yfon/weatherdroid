## Overview

This is a Weather Application for Android OS. The app is built with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**, targeting API level 28 (Android 9) and above. It enables users to view the current weather for their location or select from a list of major cities.

## Features

- **Current Location Weather:**  
  - Obtains the user's current latitude and longitude using Android's location services (LocationManager).
  - Performs reverse geocoding to convert coordinates to a city name using the Android SDK's `Geocoder`.

- **City Selection:**  
  - Displays the detected city name in a dropdown menu.
  - Allows users to select from a list of major cities worldwide (e.g., Ä°stanbul, Paris, Berlin, London, Tokyo, New York).
  - Fetches and displays weather data for the selected city.

- **Weather Data:**  
  - Uses the **Retrofit** library to fetch current weather information from a public REST API (such as [open-meteo.com](https://open-meteo.com/),
  - Displays temperature and a visual weather indicator (Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy, etc.) using SVG icons.

- **Modern UI:**  
  - Built with Jetpack Compose for a modern, responsive interface.
  - UI optimized for functionality, with the flexibility to enhance aesthetics.

- **Permissions:**  
  - Requests both `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` and `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` at runtime for compatibility with Android 12+ (API 31+).
  - Supports approximate location permissions as per Android guidelines.
